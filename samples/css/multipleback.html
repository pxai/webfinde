               <p>
                 Raising the bar.
                 As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value:

                 Not only working software,
                 but also well-crafted software
                 Not only responding to change,
                 but also steadily adding value
                 Not only individuals and interactions,
                 but also a community of professionals
                 Not only customer collaboration,
                 but also productive partnerships
                 That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.
